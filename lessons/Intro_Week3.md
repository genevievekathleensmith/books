Begin by writing out all weeks on the board:

### Goal for this week:
* Finished product
    * By end of week, you have an app that you’re happy with
* Get it to work
    * Add: options, additional features, make pretty
    * Reduce scope

### How to get to this goal
Don’t get lost! Do not just start coding.  

Instead, create a to-do list.

Ask yourself: *What are the things I have to finish “or else not be happy”?*

**1. Consider return to maximize**

* great, simple user experience on front end
* impressive work from data perspective on back end

**2. Determine how to get there / determine the ROI?**

* Consider feedback from Friday: these have high ROI
* Talk to other fellows
    * Get to know each others projects
    * Critique each other’s projects
* Consider alumni feedback

**3. Prioritize based on ROI**

* Try to set milestones, estimate time

**4. Execute**

* Work your way down checklist
* Cross off something at least twice a day
* Take breaks

### Friday: Demo day

* “Final product”
* Local machine OK
* AWS: workshop on Tuesday/Friday, **have project online by Friday/Monday**

### Slides for Friday:

* 1 slide on problem
* Demo finished project
* 2 slides on algorithm/data
* 2 slides on data story
* **Still 5 minutes**

Fellows working with startups: different slides but same philosophy

* **Must** have a finished project (model, actionable insights) that startup founder can implement
* **Must** Have a front end (that will be) accessible on the web (blog post, dashboard)

###Mentor visits

* More this week than weeks 1 + 2 combined
* It’s your responsibility to manage your time between working on your project, company visits, and alumni mentoring. 

###For many Fellows, this week is the hardest

* Lots to get done by end of week 3, therefore: stay late 

###This afternoon

* List specific companies coming in

###Other things this week

* Ladies night
* Intro to Demo Selection on Wednesday
* AWS workshop Tuesday/Friday
* Alumni feedback sessions
